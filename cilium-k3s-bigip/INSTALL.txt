1, setup flannel vxlan tunnel in BIG-IP
(recommend to run BIG-IP 14.1.4.2 as demo or has BIG-IP version that
has bug  ID 761753 or ID 826349 fixed)

you could run bigip.sh on BIG-IP as example, but you free to use your
own tunnel subnet range, selfip, the VNI should be 2 and flannel_vxlan has to be exact same

2, run k3s-cilium.sh on your VM

./k3s-cilium.sh -h

Usage: ./k3s-cilium.sh
         -n <k3s node ip>
         -s <BIGIP tunnel subnet>
         -i <BIGIP vlan selfip>
         -m <BIGIP flannel_vxlan interface mac>
         -v <BIGIP tunnel vni>
         -h help

for example:

./k3s-cilium.sh -n 10.169.72.129 -s 10.0.88.0/24 -i 10.169.72.34 -m 00:50:56:a0:7d:d8 -v 2

That is it!

you should be able to ping pod IP from BIG-IP, and deploy your ingress/configmap
